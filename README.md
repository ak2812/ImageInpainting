# Image Inpainting using Deep Learning Models
I’m comparing the results of three recent papers: Semantic Image Inpainting with Deep Generative Models (SIIDGM), Globally and
Locally Consistent Image Completion (GLCIC), Generative Image Inpainting with Contextual Attention (GIICA). I’m also presenting the results from my method by improving upon them. 
The details can be found in ../FinalProjectReport.pdf

# My architecture first approach

# Requirements

- Python 3
- TensorFlow 1.3
- OpenCV
- pyamg
Install tensorflow toolkit neuralgym (run pip install git+https://github.com/JiahuiYu/neuralgym).


# Usage

## I. Prepare the training data

Put the images for training the "data/images" directory and convert images to npy format.

```
$ cd data
$ python to_npy.py
```

## II. Train the model

```
$ cd src
$ python train.py
```

You can download the trained model file:(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ik9CRomi0fUFcF602NXHRcx08It5htlg/view?usp=sharing)

## II. Test the model
```
$ cd src/test
$ python test.py
```

My changes are mostly in network.py file. 
Have forked some of the code from https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting


**For the second approach**
Use this github link https://github.com/moodoki/semantic_image_inpainting and replace model.py file with the model.py file attached in this code.
